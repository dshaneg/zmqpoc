# ZeroMQ POC
## Actually, just working through [The Guide](http://zguide.zeromq.org/page:all) 

Working through the sample code from the guide in C#, making mostly very small tweaks here and there.
The solution is broken down by chapter and then exercise.

Using the "[ZeroMQ](https://github.com/zeromq/clrzmq4/)" nuget package for my projects,
even thought it's a tad dirty in that it adds the c libraries to your project as content and you need
to set the dlls' "Copy to Output Directory" property to "Copy if Newer" manually to make it work.

The solution contains a batch files for launching multiple apps for exercises where this is warranted.

I'm still working through the guide so this is a work in progress.
